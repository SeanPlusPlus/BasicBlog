Hello there, how's it going? I hope that all is well.

So ... This is a very basic blog I have been developing using Ruby on Rails. 

My goal is to have these features working out of the box:

  1. Restful Authentication
  2. a WYSIWYG text editor
  3. categories
  4. tags
  5. comments
  * Absolutely zero CSS ( you can style as you wish :)

The below features are currently working (I will update this list as I add each module):

  1. Restful Authentication

Cheers, and remember to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.
