== BASIC BLOG
== @SeanPlusPlus

Hello there, how's it going? I hope that all is well.

So ... This is a very basic blog I have been developing using Ruby on Rails. 

The idea is to have these features working out of the box:

  1. Authentication (and authors)
  2. a WYSIWYG text editor
  3. categories
  4. tags
  5. comments
  * Absolutely zero CSS ( you can style as you wish :)

Right now, none of the five features listed above are working (I have stitched all of 
them together in the past, but want to do it right for each module this time around).

As I update each feature, I'll make note of it here.

Cheers, and remember to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.
